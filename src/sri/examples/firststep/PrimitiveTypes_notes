In Java, primitive types are the most basic data types.

There are eight primitive data types in Java

Whole numbers : byte,short,int,long.
Real numbers : float,double.
Single char : char
boolean value : boolean

Consider these types as the building blocks of data manipulation.
Remember that primitive data types are simply placeholders in memory for a value.

An integer is a whole number, meaning it doesn't contain a fractional element, or a decimal.
There's a specified range of values allowed for the int, which is true for most data types.
What this means is, that the allowable range of values is NOT infinite.
There's a defined minimum, and maximum value, for each numeric data type,
meaning you can't assign a number bigger or smaller (outside of that range).

Java uses the concept of a wrapper class, for all of its eight primitive data types.
A wrapper class provides simple operations, as well as some basic information about the primitive data type,
which cannot be stored on the primitive itself.
We saw that MIN_VALUE, and MAX_VALUE, are elements of this basic information, for the int data type.

Casting means to treat or convert a number, from one type to another.
