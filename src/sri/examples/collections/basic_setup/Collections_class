Its important to understand that Collections class is not the Collections Framework.
The framework contains many interfaces and implemented classes, as well as helper classes,
which this Collections class is just one example. At one time, Java had interfaces, but no support
for static or default methods on them, so useful methods were packaged in these helper classes.
Some of these methods have since been implemented on the interfaces themselves,
but there's still some functionality on the Collections class you might find useful.
